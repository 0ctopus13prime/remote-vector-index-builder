    Abstract base class defining the interface for object storage operations.

    This class provides a common interface for reading and writing blobs to various
    object storage implementations (e.g., S3, local filesystem, etc.).

    All concrete implementations of object storage must inherit from this class
    and implement the abstract methods.

        Args:
            remote_store_path (str): The path/key to the remote object to be downloaded
            bytes_buffer (BytesIO): A bytes buffer where the downloaded data will be stored
